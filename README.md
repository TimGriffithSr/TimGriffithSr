- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimGriffithSr
- 👀 Formerly an MIS and IT Mgr, and life long artist (50+ years oil painting)
- 👀 I am developing a data app that collects 1) artwork information 2) exhibit history (a digital portfolio /resume )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript to create a module that does 3 specific things to images taken of 2D artwork
      1. straighten the artwork rectangle within the image to the horizontal and vertical edges (Perpestive Transform)
      2. resize that resulting image to the size ratio of the original artwork (and crop any non-artwork rows/columns from the edges)
      3. Generate 5 images from that result
          1. HD image in the in the greatest width/height (adjusted to ratio) and dpi the original image provides
          2. A copy with 1200 pixels for the longest side @ 72 dpi (the format many exhibits require for online entry)
          3. A copy with 11" width and/or 6" height @ 72dpi (for web presentations and pdf catalogs)
          4. A copy with 11" width and/or 6" height @ dpi the original image provides (for print catalog presentations)
          5. A copy with 300 pxl x 300 pxl @ 72dpi as a thumbnail (requires user input to select what part of the transformed image is within the square)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning to create a layer over the original image canvas of a rectangle with freeform (not flex) 'crosshair' corners (adjustable when in focus with mouse or arrow keys). The coordinates of the adjustable rectangle corners then become data for the 'starting points' of the perspective transform... (and when a corner is in focus it could possibly magnify)
- 💞️ I have developed this digital portfolio for over a decade now. The majority of it is in a data devopment program with a standalone user engine. This data program does not have functionalities that require operating system frameworks like Perspective Transform (Affinity). I would like to complete this soon, and publish it for a very small fee because 1) I'm retired and am fine with my income. 2) most artists have small income and large expenses. I must learn a programming language and javascript seems to have the robustness, precision, and ability to do this without the need to learn a larger IDE like Xcode
